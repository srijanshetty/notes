Call by value:
    Copy the value to the function

Call by refernce:

    needed.

Short Circuit evaluation:

Top-down:
    Divide and conquer algorithm ;
    where we break a large problem into smaller ones without knowing what the
    sub-sytems are; the sub-systems are then specified in great details.

Bottom-up:
    Dynamic Programming;
    here we see the smaller problem and then compose to form the larger problem.
