# git stash
-----------
In case you have switch branches and don't want to commit the dirty state, you can stash changes.

    git stash save "message"

Now when you have completed the other feature and you return, you can

    git stash apply stash@{1}

This will apply the stash but not delete it, you can as well

    git stash pop

To list all the stashes, we use

    git stash list

To delete a stash entry, run the command

    git stash drop

A handy feature is to create a new branch from a stash, which takes you to the state you were when
stashing. (This particular feature has the additional benefit of dropping the stash as well)

    git stash branch "test"

Note: The index and the working directory get stashed, so when you apply the stash, the changes in 
the index appear in your working directory as well. stash also provides the option of restoring the
state of the index with

    git stash apply --index

# removing files
----------------
To remove a file from the current working directory use

    git rm <filename>

To stop tracking a file, we can add it into the gitignore, but this will not work if the file was already
being tracked. In such a scenario, the following command needs to be run to stop tracking the file.

    git rm --cached <filename>

Note: The file remains in the history even after these operations

# git diff
----------
Git diff provides multitude of options. For starters, by defualt it views the difference between the working
copy and the index

    git diff

To see the difference between the working copy and HEAD, one could run

    git diff HEAD

Another useful diff is that between the HEAD and the index, which essentially tells you about the commit

    git diff --cached HEAD

git diff is really versatile because it can show the diff between any two commits as well

    git diff <commit1> <commit2>

Sometimes, we don't want to see the entire diff of the repo but that of a single file, in such a case we can run

    git diff <filename>

# git tag
---------
Always use an annotated tag so that git describe can be used later on

    git tag -am "This is a tag"

# git describe
--------------
Gives the number of commits relative to a previous tag which was made.
