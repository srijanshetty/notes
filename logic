Logic
a logical system is a formal system along with formal semantics
    A formal system has an alphabet
    It has a grammar for constructing well formed formulas
    It has certain axioms
    It has certain rules of deduction

A logical system has two parts, a syntactic componenet(proof theory) and a
semantic component (called model theory).

The syntactic component essentially deals with manipulation of formula to prove
statements, several proof systems exists:
    1. Natural deduction
    2. Resolution Refutation
    3. etc

The semantic component assigns a meaning to all these statements and then tries
to interpret the validity of other statements.

We say that a statement is derivable if there exists a proof for it, that is
starting from theorems and axioms and using inference rules, we can conclude
that particular statement.

We say that a statement is true or valid if under all interpretations, it is
assigned a truth value of true.

Godel's completeness theorem forms the link between model theory and proof
theory.
A sound system is one in which all the statements which can be derived by the
grammar are true.
A complete system is one in which all the true statements are derivable

Entailment means logical consequence, under a set of premises, what can be
concluded.

Proof theory is syntactic manipulation. For example P and Q in proof theory
implies P and it implies Q. There is not extra meaning of and. But in model
theory we say that and returns true whenever both it's statements are true.

Decidability deals with model theory and deals with the fact whether the
validity of a statement can be checked or not.
Propositional Logic is decidable while First Order logic is not.
