# Indian Law System
## Constitutional Law
The body of law as enshrined in the constitution.

## Statutory Law
Written Law set down by the legislature in the form of statutes.
They are subordinated by constitutional law.

## Common Law Legal System
A common law system gives great precendential advantage to common law or the body of
precedent. Courts are bound to follow the precedent (stare decisis). But if the case
is fundamentally different (matter of first impression) than the court can set the
precedent.
Common law is the law set by the judiciary

## Regulatory Law
Delegated Legislation is a law made by an executive body under the powers given to them
by the primary legislation. Regulation fleshes out the details of the statutes set down by
the legislation with recourse to its experience. This aids in changing the implementation
as and when required without the hassle of lengthy legislative discourses.

# Adversarial System
Two advocates are pitted against each other with the motive of convincing an impartial jury
or judge of their perspectives of the case.

## Prosecutor
The prosecutor is the legal party responsible for presenting the case in a criminal case 
against an individual accused of breaking the law.

## Defence
The party accused of committing the crime.

## Appellate Court
The court that is empowered to hear an appeal against a lower court.

# Criminal Law
The body of law that relates to crime. It prescribes social conduct and proscribes activities
that endanger the health and security of the citizens. The emphasis of criminal law is more
on punishment unlike civil law.

# Civil Law
It deals with all cases that are non criminal in nature and involve dispute resolution.
