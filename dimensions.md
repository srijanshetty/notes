# Oth dimension
The 0th dimension contains a dot it’s nothing more but pure information

# 1st dimension
If we take infinite dots we will get a line

# 2nd dimension
If we take infinite lines, the result is a plane

# 3rd dimension
If we take infinite planes, we get space

# 4th dimension
This one is a little trickier so if we add another
dimension to space we get this weird looking thing
called and tesseract. Previously we always added
another dimension by taking the previous object (black)
twice and adding new lines (red) connecting each
corner. To understand the resutling concept of the 4th
dimension, we need to imagine one single element of
the 4th dimension. If one element of the 1st dimension
is a dot an element of the 2nd dimension is a line an
element of the 3rd dimension is a plane that means one
element of the 4th dimension is space.

Very confusing, but if we imagine the 4th dimension
being time, everything starts to make sense. One
element of the 4th dimension is exactly one moment in
the universe. Meaning that the universe in its current
state is one of infinite elements of the 4th dimension. If
every moment was part of a line this line would
represent the history and future of our universe.

It goes even further, we can add another dimension.
The 4th dimension as a whole is the history of a whole
universe, the 5th dimension as a whole is every possible
history of the universe. That means it contains every
possible outcome for every event in the history of the
universe. Adolf Hitler winning the war, the dinosaurs
never being extinct by an asteroid and so on.

If we add another dimension it gets beyond human
comprehension. It means not only every possible
universe, but every possible concept of physical
constants. If we go further, we get every possible
concept of logical and physical laws. We go even further
and we get every possible concept of existence itself.

Keep in mind this is a model for understanding a
concept. It's not how it really looks like or works, it's a
way to understand. If you ask how our universe started
to exist and what the first of all events was, you know
that time is just one dimension of many. Our
understanding of time is that one thing happenes after
the other. Physics tell us that time and cause are just
purely concepts of our minds.We happen to live in a
universe with physical laws that allow consciousness to
exist and travel along the 4th dimensional ''line''. We are
just seeing one moment after the other, infact the
history of our universe just exists, not in a particular
order. It's a line, the line always exists, it goes infintly
into the future and past. There is no first or last, it is like
written in a book that has never been written, we are
reading it, but how you read it or where you start
depends on who is reading it.

The real question is not why anything exists, but if
anything does not exist
