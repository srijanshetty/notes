URLs vs. URIs: Differences and Examples
=======================================

![urluri](http://danielmiessler.com/images/urluri.png)

There are many classic tech debates, and the question of what to
formally call web addresses is one of the most nuanced. The way this
normally manifests is someone asks for the "URL" to put into his or her
browser, and someone perks up with,

> Actually, that's called a *URI*, not a URL...

The response to this correction can range from quietly thinking this
person needs to get out more, to agreeing indifferently via shoulder
shrug, to removing the safety clasp on a Katana. This page hopes to
serve as a simple, one page summary for navigating the subtleties of
this debate.

URI, URL, URN
-------------

As the image above indicates, there are three distinct components at
play here. It's usually best to go to the source when discussing matters
like these, so here's an exerpt from Tim Berners-Lee, et. al. in [RFC
3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic
Syntax:](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 "RFC3986")

> A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of
> characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.

> A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both. The
> term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL) refers to the subset of URIs
> that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of
> locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism
> (e.g., its network "location").

[Wikipedia captures this
well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier "Uniform Resource Identifier - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")
with the following simplification:

> One can classify URIs as locators (URLs), or as names (URNs), or as
> both. A Uniform Resource Name (URN) functions like a person's name,
> while a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) resembles that person's street
> address. In other words: the URN defines an item's identity, while the
> URL provides a method for finding it.

So we get a few things from these descriptions:

1.  First of all (as we see in the diagram as well) a URL is **a type of
    URI**. So if someone tells you that a URL is not a URI, he's wrong.
    But that doesn't mean all URIs are URLs. All butterflies fly, but
    not everything that flies is a butterfly.
2.  The part that makes a URI a URL is the inclusion of the "access
    mechanism", or "network location", e.g. `http://` or `ftp://`.
3.  The URN is the "globally unique" part of the identification; it's a
    unique name.

So let's look at some examples of URIs--again from the RFC:

-   `ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1808.txt`
-   `http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt`
-   `ldap://[2001:db8::7]/c=GB?objectClass?one`
-   `mailto:John.Doe@example.com`
-   `news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix`
-   `tel:+1-816-555-1212`
-   `telnet://192.0.2.16:80/`
-   `urn:oasis:names:specification:docbook:dtd:xml:4.1.2`

Those are all URIs, and some of them are URLs. Which are URLs? The ones
that show you how to get to them. Again, the name vs. address analogy
serves well.

Summary
-------

So this brings us to the all-important question: **Which is the more
proper term when referring to web addresses?** Based on the dozen or so
articles and RFCs I read while researching for this post, I'd say that
**URI** is probably the better term to use.

Why?

Well, because we often use URIs in forms that don't technically qualify
as a URL. For example, you might be told that a file you need is located
at `files.hp.com`. That's a URI, not a URL--and that system might very
well respond to many protocols over many ports. If you go to
`http://files.hp.com` you could conceivably get completely different
content than if you go to `ftp://files.hp.com`. And this type of thing
is only getting more common. Think of all the different services that
live on the various Google domains.

So, if you use **URI** you'll always be technically correct, and if you
use **URL** you might not be. Finally, there is significant chatter
around the term "URL" being--or becoming--deprecated. So URI is a fairly
safe choice in terms of accuracy.

That being said, [Dafydd
Stuttard](http://blog.portswigger.net/ "PortSwigger Web Security Blog")
has a different view, which is that the terms are near enough the same
so as to make it pure pedantry to differentiate. In [The Web Application
Hacker's
Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Discovering/dp/0470170778 "Amazon.com: The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Flaws (9780470170779): Dafydd Stuttard, Marcus Pinto: Books")
he states:

> The correct technical term for a URL is actually URI (or uniform
> resource identifier), but this term is really only used in formal
> specifications and by those who wish to exhibit their pedantry.

Indeed.

Final word? If you don't mind being "that guy", **URI** is probably the
more accurate term to use. But if you are in the linguist / "use what's
understood" camp, feel free to side with Dafydd and go with **URL**. ::
