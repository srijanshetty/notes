Hypervisor
==========
A hypervisor, also called a virtual-machine monitor, is the software that implements virtual machines.
It is designed for the sole purpose of running de-privileged “guest” operating systems on top (except for the deceptive pseudo-virtualizers).
As such it is (or contains) a kernel (defined as software running in the most privileged mode of the hardware).

Microkernel
===========
A microkernel is a minmal base for building arbitrary systems (including virtual machines).
It is characterised as containing the minmal amount of code that must run in the most privileged mode of the hardware in order to build arbitrary (yet secure) systems.
