# .NET
- It is a framework which provides a runtime called CLR (Common Language
Runtime).
- Many languages can run on CLR. Ergo .NET provides language interoperability

# LINQ
- It is a generalization of the concept of a query language.
- The data source for link is an object. Hence any data source can be used by
LINQ as long as there exists a data provider which can covert the data source
to a queryable object.
- C# desugars the declarative syntax of LINQ into method calls.
- A LINQ provider is a library which converts a particular source in objects that
can be handled by LINQ. Additionally, they also define the standard query operators
on them.
