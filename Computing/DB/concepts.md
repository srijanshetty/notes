Concepts
========

## Indexes
- A data structure which helps in finding results faster.

## Model
- The data stored in the database is called the model.

## View
- Any query operation on the model generates a view.

## Transactions
An indivisible operation is called a transaction. A transaction must fail or
succeed, it cannot be partially complete.

### Transactional Memory
- Allows a group of load store operations happen atomically.

### Software transactional memory
- It is a concurrency control mechanism.
- Just like database transactions, access to shared memory is transactional.

ACID
====
The ACID principles have to be followed by any database in order for it to be called reliable.

## Atomicity
- This means every transaction is a *all or nothing* deal, either the transaction goes through completely or it doesn't happen at all.

## Consistency
- Consistency is specified by the domain.
- When we say that a database is consistent, we mean that it follows whatever consistency rules that have been set forth by the domain before and after a transaction.

## Isolation
- Isolation requires that a transaction happens in an isolated fashion on its own copy of the database.
- This ensures that the database is not affected by any other transaction.

## Durability
- Durability is a guarantee that if any transaction gets committed, then it stays
  in the memory for sure.
- **Availability**
    Even if one of the data-centres fail, we should be able to access our data. This property is called availability.
- **Resilience**
    If any of the data-centres fail, we have a backup data-centre.

Consistency Models
====================

## Serializable transactions
A way to reason about transactions, it guarantees that transactions can be thought of as happening serially.

## Eventual consistency
- Transactions will be eventually applied.
- A transaction will be applied to some replica and finally all of them will be copied into all records.
- The order of transactions is not honoured.

## Quorum Consistency
- The transaction is committed only a quorum of databases have committed it.

## Timeline Consistency
- The master gets updated and a timeline is replayed to the secondarys, which
    are either at the same level as the master or lagging behind.

Consistency vs Availability(Latency/Response Time) Debate
==================================
- We can have relaxed consistency for availability.
- A business like hotels may want high availability, hence it allows for double bookings as it always has extra rooms.

Scaling
=======

## Horizontal Scaling
- Adding more nodes to the cluster and partitioning the data

## Vertical Scaling
- Keeping the data in one place but adding more compute power to the server.

## Data-warehouse
- This collects information from different databases.
- This is meta data about databases, used for queries by higher level management.

Databases
=========

## Data-centre
- A group of networked computer servers used for remote storage and distribution of large amount of data.
- They had redundant power supply, network supply.
- Might consume as much power as a small town.
- Plus they need air conditioning.

Service Level Agreement
=======================
A clause in a service contract.

Bulk Loading
============
- Usually data is inserted one at a time in a database.
- Bulk loading allows a chunk of data to be inserted into the database at once.

Reference
=========
- Availability: Low latency
- Fault Tolerant: Reliable, replication
- Distributed: Scalability
- Performance: Throughput/Latency
- Consistency:
