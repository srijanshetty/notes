[Deprecated] Will use Anki for all kinds of notes henceforth

# About

- This project started as an method to catalogue notes about topics which I read. But I've realized the futility of storing contents without recollection, hence I've decided to move to Anki. Not only will it allow me to catalogue data in a convinient format, it will also help me remember all of it.
- But this doesn't mean that I've found a panacea for note-taking. Anki can help in notes taking and recollection. I'm still dependent on Evernote for taking snapshots of articles and notes for the time being and until I find a better solution for the same.
