The inverse of a diagonal matrix is equal to inverse of its diagonal entries

An invertible matrix is of full rank

A positive definite matrix is one such that z'Mz > 0 for all z.

z'z is symmetric

In case the covariance matrix is diagonal, then the gaussian distribution is a product of
individual components.

Level sets and isocountours.

Multivariate Gaussians

# Linear Transformations
------------------------
They change the basis and in doing so, they can only rotate, expand, shrink or translate 
the basis
Every Linear Transformation can be expressed as a Matrix. 

# Superposition in LA
---------------------

1. A[x y z] = [Ax Ay Az]
2. Ae_i = C_i
3. Multiplication of two matrices and IP
4. Linear combination: (Row-row/ Column-column)
    1. If the vectors are the columns of M then Y = MA.
    2. If they are the rows of M then Y = AM
