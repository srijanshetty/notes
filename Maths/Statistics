# Stationary Process
---------------------------------------------
A process is called stationary if the values attained by the process are within certain
epsilon bounds.

# Independent and Identically Distributed
---------------------------------------------
This is one of the assumptions made before statistical inference. This means the following:

1. The data is randomly scattered about the mean, and shows no trends in this scattering.
2. The data has a constant variance and this variance has no systematic trends. 
3. The data points are independent of each other.

In a gist, a sample is random if it is stationary and independent. In a time series plot or 
a run chart, this translates to the following:

1. Compared to a random order plot of the same data, the original plot is not smooth. 
( This means that there is no dependence, because dependence brings in smoothness. )
2. With time the scattering of data does not change systematically.
3. With time, the scattering of data does not change systematically.

Note: Systematically over here means an increasing/decreasing trend or any general trend.

# Statistical Inference
---------------------------------------------
These are inferences on the data which have statistical backing in terms of a number
which expresses the reliability.

In a population, you have all the measurements at your disposal. While in the case of a 
process, the data points are being generated.

## Sampling a Population
The following features are desirable from any sample:

1. It should be IID.
2. It should be representative of the population, i.e., the distribution of the sample
must be similar to the distribution of the population.
3. There should exist some mathematical relationship between the sample and the
population.

### Simple Random Sampling
Every 'n' subset of the population has an equal chance of being in the subset. (The chosen
'n' is small compared to the population and the population is assumed to be stationary when 
the sampling is going on). A certain caveat needs to be stated here, a sampling where every
member has an equal probability of being in the sample need not be SRS. Consider for example 
case in which we have two decks of black and red cards and we select five cards on the basis
of a coin toss. In such a scenario, each individual card has an equal chance of being in the 
final deck but in no hand will red and black cards be together.

## Sampling a Process
We use systematic sampling instead of SRS. In case of systematic sampling, we chose a 'k' 
from the first 'm' items and the same 'k' henceforth.
This is better than SRS because it can create an IID sample even if the process is not IID,
because the dependency between adjacent observations, dies off with distance. Also, this can
capture scenarios where the production line may have failed after the afternoon and the SRS
sample only had data points in the morning.
