#Space
A space is a set with some structure.

A structure is a set with some mathematical object which makes it easier to study the set.

Mathematical objects are numbers, funtions, relations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Analysis
Mathematical Analysis deals with differntiaion, integration, infinite series and sequences,
limits and analytic functions.

Calculus is the study of change and includes differentiation, integration, infinite sequences.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Number Theory
The queen of mathematics, deals with the properties of integers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Algebra
Algebra is the study of operations and their application in solvind equations. The operations
can be applied to any mathematical objects. Linear algebra, abstract algebra.

Linear Algebra is the study of vector spaces and linear transformations.

A vector space is an abelian group which is closed under addition and scalar multiplication
by any field.

#Geometry
Geometry is the study of shapes.

Analytic Geometry or Cartesian Geometry is the study of shapes using formulae and analysis 
and algebra. The idea is to represent shapes with equations and derive numerical
information about them from this.

Synthetic Geometry is the study of shapes without recourse to analysis and algebra.

Euclidean Geometry deals with a certain set of premises and deductions that can 
be made from them.

Computational Geometry : algorithmic problems that can be expressed in terms of 
geometry.

#Reasoning
Open world assumption : Everything not known may be true.

Closed domain of discourse : Everything not known is false.

Deduction reasoning : From premises, infer conclusions in a closed domain of discourse

Inductive reasoning : From premises, come to the most probable conclusion using
the open world assumption.
