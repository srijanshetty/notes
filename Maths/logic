# Formal System
-----------------------------------
A formal system is a well defined system of abstract thought.
It consists of 
    A formal system has an alphabet
    It has a grammar for constructing well formed formulas
    It has certain axioms
    It has certain rules of deduction

When we talk about formalism, we mean that there exists a formal system for this
system

# Logic
-----------------------------------
a logical system is a formal system along with formal semantics
    A formal system has an alphabet
    It has a grammar for constructing well formed formulas
    It has certain axioms
    It has certain rules of deduction

A logical system has two parts, a syntactic componenet(proof theory) and a
semantic component (called model theory).

# Syntax
-----------------------------------
The syntactic component essentially deals with manipulation of formula to prove
statements, several proof systems exists:
    1. Natural deduction
    2. Resolution Refutation
    3. etc

Proof theory is syntactic manipulation. For example P and Q in proof theory
implies P and it implies Q. There is not extra meaning of and. But in model
theory we say that and returns true whenever both it's statements are true.

# Sematics
-----------------------------------
The semantic component assigns a meaning to all these statements and then tries
to interpret the validity of other statements.

Decidability deals with model theory and deals with the fact whether the
validity of a statement can be checked or not.
Propositional Logic is decidable while First Order logic is not.

# Derivable
-----------------------------------
We say that a statement is derivable if there exists a proof for it, that is
starting from theorems and axioms and using inference rules, we can conclude
that particular statement.

We say that a statement is true or valid if under all interpretations, it is
assigned a truth value of true.

Entailment means logical consequence, under a set of premises, what can be
concluded.

# Completeness and Soundness
-----------------------------------
Godel's completeness theorem forms the link between model theory and proof
theory.
A sound system is one in which all the statements which can be derived by the
grammar are true.
A complete system is one in which all the true statements are derivable
