#Space
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A space is a set with some structure.

A structure is a set with some mathematical object which makes it easier to study the set.

Mathematical objects are numbers, funtions, relations

# Topology
Also called rubber sheet geometry, it is geometry in the most basic form. 
The notion of size and angle is dropped and we consider only shape. 
Also any transformation of the shape which keeps it continious like squashing and stretching are allowed (but cutting and pasting are not).

# Metric Space
Is a set with R with a metric function d which satisfies the natural properties of a "metric"
or distance.

Positive Definite
d(x,y) >= 0 and d(x,y) = 0 iff x = y

Symmteric
d(x,y) = d(y,x)

Triangle Inequality
d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z)
